Project Tasks,
Visualizations,
Main Page: map of US parks with info about each park (interactive),
1) Map with overlay of US national parks,
2) Picture/icon of one region that takes you to that specific region (next page shows this info: general information about the parks in select region; bar chart showing # of visits in each park; and images of the parks),
3) Dropdown with a (bar/pie/line) chart that shows # of parks per state in each region; potentially colorcode the bars with activities in each state; and also add a legend to depict colors for each activity,
,
Other Pages (resulting from 2nd visualization):,
1) Drop down for top 10 parks,
"2) Ranking parks by regions (East Coast, Central, West Coast)",
3) Chart with rank of states with most parks,
4) About page: synopsis/scope of project w/team info,
5) Prospective park activities (could be another drop down),
6) Potentially use webcam access to select parks; link,
7) Section on main page with select info about top 10 parks (could be any kind of info),

Steps:,
1) Find relevant data sources with info on parks,
2) Retrieving data and conducting data cleaning/processing,
3) Extract activity data,GP
"3) Storing activity data and Kaggle data into our database (e.g. SQL, Mongo)","QX, YZ"
4) Query our database to analyze the data (use Pandas) ,TBD
5) Use Flask to make API call (refer to recent assignment - w/sqlite analysis; sqlalchemy),EE
6) Use HTML and JavaScript libraries to create our front end webpages (potential pages listed above),WC ++
