# Project3-NationalTreasure

National Parks Project Description: 

The National Parks project is a web application that allows users to explore national parks across the United States. The application utilizes data from various sources including Kaggle and Data World to provide users with detailed information about each park including its location and activities.

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing users to filter parks by region and view detailed information about each park. The backend of the application is built using a Flask server and MongoDB to handle data storage and retrieval. This allows for efficient and seamless data retrieval, providing users with the most up-to-date information about the parks.

Overall, the National Parks project is an ideal tool for nature enthusiasts, hikers, and anyone looking to explore and learn more about the national parks of the United States and territories.

* Flask - This is a Flask application that connects to a MongoDB database and serves data from it through different routes. The app sets up a connection to a MongoDB           database running on the localhost on port 27017 and defines several routes to handle HTTP requests.  
* PyMongo - is a Python library that allows for easy interaction with MongoDB, a NoSQL document-based database. It allows for the insertion, retrieval, and                       manipulation of data in MongoDB using Python.
* Web API:  https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/changelog.htm
* .csv file: Kaggle.csv
* Jinja2 -  is a templating engine for Python that allows for the separation of the presentation logic and the application logic. It is a powerful and flexible engine             that is often used with Flask to render templates and generate dynamic HTML pages.
* MongoDB Compass: Allows users to easily interact with and manage their MongoDB databases without having to use the command line interface.
